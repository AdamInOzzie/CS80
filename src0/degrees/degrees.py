    For each person, get the neighbors of that person if not target in one, push those neighbors
    onto the frontier  and then explore the neighbors of those neighbors until the target is found.

    Neighbors is pairs of (movie_id, person_id) and are really only used to traverse through to
    related people, but because UX wants to know the movies that connect them, we keep track of
    the movie_id as well. When every we process any person, we can find all people that
    they are related to through the movies and thus there is no point in trying to process
    that person again once they have been explored. Put diffeently, we should never need to
    call neighbors_for_person on a person that has already been explored. To optimize this, we
    will keep track of explored people in a set.

    Put differently, each state A is a set of people in a movie and each edge is to another movie B if
    one or more people in set A acted in that movie because that allows us to traverse to that
    state. In essence each Action is a movie from one state to another.
    Transitioning to a state means that we can find all the people in that movie and then
    explore those people to see if they are the target person.

    Essentially, start with the movies that the source person has starred in. The neighbors_for_person function
    will return a set of (movie_id, person_id) pairs for people who starred with the source person.
    If the target person is in those movies, then we can return the path

    The neighbors of those movies
    If the target person is not in those movies, then explore the neighbors of those movies.
    The neighbors are the movies that other people have starred in with the source person.
    If the target person is not found, then continue to explore the neighbors of those movies
    until the target person is found.
